# The iCalendar Introduction

iCalendar is a standard method of transferring calendar information between computer systems. The standard allows products from many vendors to transfer calendar information between each other.  iCalendar files typically have the file extension ".ical" ".ics" ".ifb"  or ".icalendar" with a MIME type of "text/calendar".

The iCalendar open standard should not be confused with iCal, the former name for the commercial product "Calendar" developed by Apple Computer.

## Package for this project

Want to create online calendars so that you can display them on an iPhone's calendar app or in Google Calendar? This can be done by generating calendars in the iCalendar format (RFC 5545), a textual format that can be loaded by different applications.

The format of such calendars is defined in RFC 5545, which is not a pleasant reading experience. This package implements RFC 5545 and some extensions from RFC 7986 to provide you an easy to use API for creating calendars. It's not our intention to implement these RFC's entirely but to provide a straightforward API that's easy to use.

The library was designed for developers who want to deal with CSV data using modern code and without the high levels of bootstrap and low-levels of usefulness provided by existing core functions or third-party code.
